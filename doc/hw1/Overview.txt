Solution:

I created a single class, Elevator, that tracks passenger destinations with an array
where the floor number is the index into the array. To avoid the offset of floor number
to array index (floor numbers start at 1 while the array index starts at 0) the array
is created with an index one larger than the building. When boarding a passenger the
floor number is checked to ensure it is between these two limits before adding the
passenger.

One assumption was that the elevator would go to continuous floors, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.
If the elevator could not stop at a floor between these limits this design would have to
change significantly.


Classes:

	Elevator 		- The base elevator class that tracks passengers.
	ElevatorTest	- A class that instantiates Elevator and boards several passengers
					before moving the Elevator up and down the building several times.
