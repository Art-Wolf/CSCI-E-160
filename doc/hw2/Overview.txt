Overview
Purpose
   Have an elevator object move people amongst several floor objects that make up a building. Exception handling
   is demonstrated with an elevator capacity.

Brief description
   The elevator initalizes and creates seven Floor objects, passsing each one the floor number it represents, a
   random number of people waiting for the elevator and the Elevator object itself so that each floor can
   register a request for an elevator.

   The elevator will move up the floors and only stop at a floor that either requested it or current passengers
   that are in the elevator are destined for.

Goals
Primary Requirements:
   1. Creating a Floor object per floor in the building.
   2. Pass control from the Elevator to the Floor.
   3. Have the Floor unload passengers from the Elevator.
   4. Throw an exception when the the Elevator attempts to exceed capacity.
Secondary Requirements:
   1. Have the Floor register a request for an Elevator.
   2. Unregister a request when an Elevator arrives.
   3. Reregister a request if people remain on the Floor.

Assumptions
   Demonstrate enumeration and ensure javadoc matches offical style. 

Risks
   Due to the use of random generation, there is the possibility that everything will be initialzed with 0 passengers,
   in which case the elevator will not move from the first floor.

Current procedure/functionality
