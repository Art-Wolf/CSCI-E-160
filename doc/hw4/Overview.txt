Overview
Purpose
   Complete the server implementation of an ATM system.

Brief description
   There is a single account that is initialized with a zeo balance. The server decodes the commands sent via the Client
   and calls the appropriate methods in the ATMImplementation.

   There are several exceptions that can be thrown
      - If a negative amount is recieved for a deposit.
      - If a withdrawal would result in a negative balance.

Goals
Primary Requirements:
   1. Create an Account class.
   2. Create a server side ATM implementation.
   3. Unit test the stipulated classes.
Secondary Requirements:
   1. Generate the jar via ant.
   2. Incorporate JUNIT into ant.

Assumptions
   Do not alter the client or server code.

Risks
   Can find no instance why the balance might throw an ATM Exception.
